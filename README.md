# Single-cell analyses reveal increased gene expression variability in human neurodevelopmental conditions

Code used for paper titled "Single-cell analyses reveal increased gene expression variability in human neurodevelopmental conditions"

We calculated cell-type variability, using method from Liu et al., and gene-level variability analysis, using methods from Brennecke et al., Osorio et al., and Cai.
