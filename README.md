# Increased transcriptional variance in human Trisomy 21 revealed by single-cell analyses

Code used for paper titled "Increased transcriptional variance in human Trisomy 21 revealed by single-cell analyses"

We calculated cell-type variability, using method from Liu et al., and gene-level variability analysis, using methods from Brennecke et al., Osorio et al., and Cai.
